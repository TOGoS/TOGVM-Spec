Leaving:

  Door open?
  
    Yes:
    
      Assume n > 0
      Leave open
      Exit, ++n
      Assume n > 1
    
    No:
    
      Assume n = 0
      Open door
      Exit, ++n
      Assume n = 1

Returning when n = 1

  Actual n may be > 1.

  Door open?
  
    Yes?
    
      Assume we opened it and that n still = 1
      Enter, --n
      Assume n = 0
      Close door
    
    No?
    
      Some jerk found the door open but closed it.

Returning when n > 1

  Door open?
  
    Yes?
    
      Assume n > 1
      Enter, --n
      Assume n > 0

    No?
    
      The person who originally opened it must have come back and closed it, thinking n = 1.
      
      Assume n = 1 (just you)
      Enter, --n
      Assume n = 0
      Close door

Moral:
- As long as the person who opened the door does not close it, it should remain open.
- If the person who opened the door closes it, it should remain closed.
